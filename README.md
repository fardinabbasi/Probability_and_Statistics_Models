  ## Q1: Win/Lose Game
  The **win/Lose game** is played by throwing two dice. We define winning and losing in this game as follows:
    <div>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 7 or 11, the player wins. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, throwing continues until: </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> new sum equals the prior sum; which player wins. </li>
        <li> new sum  equals 7; which player wins. </li>
      </ol>

  ## Q2: Birthday Problem
  The [birthday problem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/birthday-paradox/), a concept in probability theory, revolves around determining the likelihood of at least two individuals sharing a birthday within a randomly selected group of n people. Interestingly, the birthday paradox demonstrates that even with a group as small as 23 people, the probability of finding a shared birthday surpasses 50%, contrary to what one might intuitively expect.

## Q3: Buffon's Needle Problem
[Buffon's needle](https://datagenetics.com/blog/may42015/index.html) is an intriguing problem in geometric probability that dates back to 1777 when it was first proposed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The problem revolves around dropping a needle onto a set of parallel lines, often visualized as a collection of parallel wooden floorboards. What makes this problem particularly fascinating is that the probabilities associated with it are directly linked to the mathematical constant Pi.
