    <div>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 7 or 11, the player wins. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, throwing continues until: </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> new sum equals the prior sum; which player wins. </li>
        <li> new sum  equals 7; which player wins. </li>
      </ol>
