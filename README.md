  ## Q1: Win/Lose Game
  The **win/Lose game** is played by throwing two dice. We define winning and losing in this game as follows:
    <div>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 7 or 11, the player wins. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, throwing continues until: </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> new sum equals the prior sum; which player wins. </li>
        <li> new sum  equals 7; which player wins. </li>
      </ol>
  </h3>
  
  ## Q2: Birthday Problem
  In probability theory, the [birthday problem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/birthday-paradox/) asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday paradox is that, counterintuitively, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 people. For more information, you can read:
