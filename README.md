  ## Q1: Win/Lose Game
  The **win/Lose game** is played by throwing two dice. We define winning and losing in this game as follows:
    <div>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 7 or 11, the player wins. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. </li>
      <li> If the sum of 2 dice is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, throwing continues until: </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> new sum equals the prior sum; which player wins. </li>
        <li> new sum  equals 7; which player wins. </li>
      </ol>

  ## Q2: Birthday Problem
  The [birthday problem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/birthday-paradox/), a concept in probability theory, revolves around determining the likelihood of at least two individuals sharing a birthday within a randomly selected group of n people. Interestingly, the birthday paradox demonstrates that even with a group as small as 23 people, the probability of finding a shared birthday surpasses 50%, contrary to what one might intuitively expect.

## Q3: Buffon's Needle Problem
[Buffon's needle](https://datagenetics.com/blog/may42015/index.html) is an intriguing problem in geometric probability that dates back to 1777 when it was first proposed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The problem revolves around dropping a needle onto a set of parallel lines, often visualized as a collection of parallel wooden floorboards. What makes this problem particularly fascinating is that the probabilities associated with it are directly linked to the mathematical constant Pi.

## Q1: Bertrand Paradox
The [Bertrand paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_paradox_(probability)) presents a challenge within the classical understanding of probability theory. Joseph Bertrand first introduced this problem in his influential publication "Calculation of Probabilities" in 1889. He used it as an illustration to demonstrate that the principle of indifference may not yield clear and precise outcomes for probabilities when applied without careful consideration, particularly when dealing with an infinite set of possibilities.
